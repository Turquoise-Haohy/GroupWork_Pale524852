### PALE: 52 48 52

How is the cyber world functioning? What is inside the black box? To explore the unknown, welcome to the Pale: 48 52 48 ! (also the ASCII code for ‘404’).
In the ancient time, when encountering something never seen before, a monster would be composed by the people to explain the mystery. In the modern time, the monster also come to rebirth with the emerging of new cyber world. We have limited clues to know how our data were cheated by the ‘cyber monster’. We would never know how the ‘monster’ sugar the pill to make everything in front our eyes to be intriguing and alluring… 

Here you could see the embodiment of our collective imagination.
Here you could experience what is happening behind your smart devices every day.
Here you might realise what you feel familiar is completely strange.
Here you might find yourself significance, but a tiny boat on the open sea…

Enjoy!
