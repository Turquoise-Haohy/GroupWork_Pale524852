General Introduction
====

How is the cyber world functioning? What is inside the black box? To explore the unknown, welcome to the Pale: 48 52 48 ! (also the ASCII code for ‘404’).
In the ancient time, when encountering something never seen before, a monster would be composed by the people to explain the mystery. In the modern time, the monster also come to rebirth with the emerging of new cyber world. We have limited clues to know how our data were cheated by the ‘cyber monster’. We would never know how the ‘monster’ sugar the pill to make everything in front our eyes to be intriguing and alluring… 

Here you could see the embodiment of our collective imagination.
Here you could experience what is happening behind your smart devices every day.
Here you might realise what you feel familiar is completely strange.
Here you might find yourself significance, but a tiny boat on the open sea…

Enjoy!

When the player puts on the VR glasses, the first thing that strikes them is the blue space of nothingness. Here is the start of the game, where you can familiarize yourself with the visuals of the immersive scenes as well as the action. You will see cookies floating in the air and the "We value your privacy" interface. This interface is a necessary action before entering the 524852 space. It requires you to provide your online privacy. The irony is that you only have options are "accept all cookies" and "No other choice". This is a metaphor for the way people's privacy is being compromised all the time in the online world, and there is nothing you can do about it.

After "Accept all cookies", you will arrive at space 524852. This is the dark web of the cyber world. It is the hidden corner of the cyber world, covering 50% of the entire cyber world. It profoundly affects people's virtual lives. Here you will see invisible cyber monsters. They're not scary, even not physical. But as you go deeper into your experience on the dark web, you will be gradually consumed by its great appearance. Eventually, you will sink deeper into the monster's body and cannot escape.

The shape is extracted from the 'Chaos' of the Shanhaijing, Chaos is the god that nurtures the world, also a place of disorder. disorder and confusion", "the condition of emptiness, unreality, and desolation". The world began as chaos, with the heavens and the earth joined together in the beginning, i.e. in a state of chaos, until the creator God separated them.

Chaos consists of a CPU at the bottom, which is connected to the main part in the middle by wires. The middle part evolves mainly from the image of a camera, representing the cyber environment we are in that is constantly under surveillance. Looking upwards, there is a hand holding up the VR glasses, as well as a pair of wings. A symbol of the invisible forces that control the virtual world.

**Introduction to the interior space：**

As you enter the interior, you will see columns filling the scene blocking your way and walls reflecting the interior, all of which confuse your location and make it difficult to find your way out.
Also floating in the scene are cookies (from the words accept all cookies when opening a web page, extracting the word cookies). You will also see numerous web windows and app icons floating around your scene. At this point you can pick up the keyboard cap on the ground and throw it at it, when it touches the pop-up window, it will disappear. The floor of the scene is covered with keyboards that make a keyboard click when you walk on them.

Borrowed from the ancient Chinese beast "讹兽（Eshou）", it has a pretty face and a body like a rabbit. It is particularly good at saying nice things, but they are not true. 
The modern version is made up of attractive things, a glittering head and a body studded with sweets and a petal-shaped skirt. When you look up from below, you may catch a glimpse of what it is carrying on top of its head: a rabbit mask. 
If you want to know, get close to it, get close to it ......

**Introduction to the interior space:**
Welcome to the interior of the "讹兽". Beneath the curved glass walls, small objects are placed on the bar around you. But it's not easy to keep your eyes on them for long, because all around you, on the coffee table above the water, there are lots of small objects falling out of the air, such as gummy bears, rubber strawberries, cupcakes and cute teapots. They look a little different from their usual appearance and all look very soft. You can grab them and put them in the air, or hit one object with another. There are surprises waiting for you as you explore.
